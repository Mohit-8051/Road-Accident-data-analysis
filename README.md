# Road-Accident-data-analysis
 This dashboard that I created shows important information on road accidents. It  allows users to see things like the number of accidents by car type, casualties by road surface, and monthly trends. This kind of data analysis can be used to inform decisions about road safety initiatives.



 Data filtering and sorting: The dashboard allows users to filter and sort data by factors such as vehicle type, road surface, and time of day. This allows users to focus on the information that is most relevant to them.
 
Charts and graphs: The dashboard uses charts and graphs to present data in a visually appealing way. This makes it easy for users to see trends and patterns in the data.

Interactive features: The dashboard may have interactive features that allow users to drill down into the data for more detail. For example, a user might be able to click on a bar chart to see a list of all the accidents that occurred on a particular type of road.
